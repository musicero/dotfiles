# Dotfiles

Enjoy my dotfiles. I have mainly used i3wm, but also have configs for both sway and Hyprland that is really similar in style.
My vim config is an extension of the LazyVim distro by folke, mostly just disabling som stuff and making it a bit prettier :)

## Usage
To quickly set up my dotfiles, you can use GNU Stow to symlink the files into the appropriate directories. Here's the basic command to get you started (you might have to move your old config files to avoid conflicts):

```Bash
# From repo root:
stow . 
```
